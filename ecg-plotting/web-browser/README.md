# ECG plotter

Plots ECGs recorded with the Attys using the Dygraphs (http://dygraphs.com)
library and jquery (https://jquery.com/).

Just load index.html with your
brower and then drop a .tsv file in the drag/drop zone.

It allows panning and zooming.

Try it out with the sample ecg in this folder.

An online version is aviable here: https://www.attys.tech/plot-ecg/
